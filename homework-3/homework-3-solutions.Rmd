## Classification

For this assignment, we will be working with part of a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) that was the subject of a machine learning competition and is often used for practicing ML models. The goal is classification; specifically, to predict which passengers would survive the [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic).

Load the data from `data/titanic.csv` into *R* and familiarize yourself with the variables it contains using the codebook (`data/titanic_codebook.txt`).

Notice that `survived` and `pclass` should be changed to factors. When changing `survived` to a factor, you may want to reorder the factor so that *"Yes"* is the first level.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

```{r}
library(klaR) # for naive bayes
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(corrplot)
library(discrim)
library(poissonreg)
library(corrr)
tidymodels_prefer()

set.seed(3435) # can be any number

titanic <- read_csv(file = "data/titanic.csv") %>% 
  mutate(survived = factor(survived, 
                           levels = c("Yes", "No")),
         pclass = factor(pclass))
titanic
```

### Question 1

Split the data, stratifying on the outcome variable, `survived.`  You should choose the proportions to split the data into. Verify that the training and testing data sets have the appropriate number of observations. Take a look at the training data and note any potential issues, such as missing data.

Why is it a good idea to use stratified sampling for this data?

```{r}
titanic_split <- titanic %>% 
  initial_split(strata = survived, prop = 0.7)
titanic_train <- training(titanic_split)
titanic_test <- testing(titanic_split)
dim(titanic_train)
dim(titanic_test)
```

*Each dataset has approximately the right number of observations; $623$ is almost exactly $70\%$ of the full data set, which contains $891$ observations.*

*It's probably a good idea to use stratified sampling here because the outcome variable is imbalanced; there are more observations for one level, 'No', than the other, 'Yes'.*

*One relatively easy way to summarize the data is `summary()`:*

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  summary()
```

*The only variable with missingness is `age`, which is missing $136$ observations.*

### Question 2

Using the **training** data set, explore/describe the distribution of the outcome variable `survived`.

*A bar chart is probably the easiest way to assess it:*

```{r}
titanic_train %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = survived)) +
  geom_bar()
```

*There's a definite class imbalance, but it's not too extreme.*

### Question 3

Using the **training** data set, create a correlation matrix of all continuous variables. Create a visualization of the matrix, and describe any patterns you see. Are any predictors correlated with each other? Which ones, and in which direction?

```{r}
titanic_train %>% 
  select(is.numeric, -passenger_id) %>% 
  cor(use = "complete.obs") %>% 
  corrplot(type = "lower", diag = FALSE)
```

*`age` and `sib_sp` are negatively correlated, which implies that older passengers are less likely to have siblings on board. `parch` and `sib_sp` are positively correlated, which implies that having one on board means having the other on board is also likely.*

### Question 4

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable `survived`. Include the following predictors: ticket class, sex, age, number of siblings or spouses aboard, number of parents or children aboard, and passenger fare.

Recall that there were missing values for `age`. To deal with this, add an imputation step using `step_impute_linear()`. Next, use `step_dummy()` to **dummy** encode categorical predictors. Finally, include interactions between:

-   Sex and passenger fare, and
-   Age and passenger fare.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.

```{r}
titanic_recipe <- recipe(survived ~ pclass + sex + age + 
                           sib_sp + parch + fare, titanic_train) %>% 
  step_impute_linear(age, impute_with = imp_vars(sib_sp)) %>% 
  # choice of predictors to impute with is up to you
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_interact(~ starts_with("sex"):age + age:fare)
```

### Question 5

Specify a **logistic regression** model for classification using the `"glm"` engine. Then create a workflow. Add your model and the appropriate recipe. Finally, use `fit()` to apply your workflow to the **training** data.

***Hint: Make sure to store the results of `fit()`. You'll need them later on.***

```{r}
log_reg <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

log_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(log_reg) %>% 
  add_recipe(titanic_recipe)

log_fit <- fit(log_wkflow, titanic_train)
```

### Question 6

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a linear discriminant analysis model for classification using the `"MASS"` engine.

```{r}
lda_mod <- discrim_linear() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("MASS")

lda_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lda_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(titanic_recipe)

lda_fit <- fit(lda_wkflow, titanic_train)
```

### Question 7

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a quadratic discriminant analysis model for classification using the `"MASS"` engine.

```{r}
qda_mod <- discrim_quad() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("MASS")

qda_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(qda_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(titanic_recipe)

qda_fit <- fit(qda_wkflow, titanic_train)
```

### Question 8

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a naive Bayes model for classification using the `"klaR"` engine. Set the `usekernel` argument to `FALSE`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
nb_mod <- naive_Bayes() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("klaR") %>% 
  set_args(usekernel = FALSE) 

nb_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(nb_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(titanic_recipe)

nb_fit <- fit(nb_wkflow, titanic_train)
```

### Question 9

Now you've fit four different models to your training data.

Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to generate predictions using each of these 4 models and your **training** data. Then use the *accuracy* metric to assess the performance of each of the four models.

```{r}
log_acc <- predict(log_fit, new_data = titanic_train, type = "class") %>% 
  bind_cols(titanic_train %>% select(survived)) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)
lda_acc <- predict(lda_fit, new_data = titanic_train, type = "class") %>% 
  bind_cols(titanic_train %>% select(survived)) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)
qda_acc <- predict(qda_fit, new_data = titanic_train, type = "class") %>% 
  bind_cols(titanic_train %>% select(survived)) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)
nb_acc <- predict(nb_fit, new_data = titanic_train, type = "class") %>% 
  bind_cols(titanic_train %>% select(survived)) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

results <- bind_rows(log_acc, lda_acc, qda_acc, nb_acc) %>% 
  tibble() %>% mutate(model = c("Logistic", "LDA", "QDA", "NB")) %>% 
  select(model, .estimate) %>% 
  arrange(.estimate)

results
```

Which model achieved the highest accuracy on the training data?

*The LDA performed the best on the training data.*

### Question 10

Fit the model with the highest training accuracy to the **testing** data. Report the accuracy of the model on the **testing** data.

```{r}
lda_test <- fit(lda_wkflow, titanic_test)

predict(lda_test, new_data = titanic_test, type = "class") %>% 
  bind_cols(titanic_test %>% select(survived)) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)
```

Again using the **testing** data, create a confusion matrix and visualize it. Plot an ROC curve and calculate the area under it (AUC).

```{r}
augment(lda_test, new_data = titanic_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

```{r}
augment(lda_test, new_data = titanic_test) %>%
  roc_curve(survived, .pred_Yes) %>%
  autoplot()
augment(lda_test, new_data = titanic_test) %>% 
  roc_auc(survived, .pred_Yes)
```

How did the model perform? Compare its training and testing accuracies. If the values differ, why do you think this is so?

*The model actually did quite well, and its accuracy slightly increased on the testing data. This is likely because the model is relatively mechanistic, so it has lower variance.*

### Required for 231 Students

In a binary classification problem, let $p$ represent the probability of class label $1$, which implies that $1 - p$ represents the probability of class label $0$. The *logistic function* (also called the "inverse logit") is the cumulative distribution function of the logistic distribution, which maps a real number *z* to the open interval $(0, 1)$.

### Question 11

Given that:

$$
p(z)=\frac{e^z}{1+e^z}
$$

Prove that the inverse of a logistic function is indeed the *logit* function:

$$
z(p)=ln\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)
$$

*To show that the inverse of the logistic function is the logit function, we can start with the logistic function:*

$$
P(z) = \frac{e^z}{1+e^z}
$$

*We'll set $P(z)=y$ for simplicity.*

$$
y+ye^z=e^z
$$

$$
y=e^z-ye^z
$$

$$
y=(1-y)e^z
$$

$$
e^z=\frac{y}{1-y}
$$

$$
ln(e^z)=ln(\frac{y}{1-y})
$$

$$
z=ln(\frac{y}{1-y})
$$

$$
z(p)=ln(\frac{p}{1-p})
$$

### Question 12

Assume that $z = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}x_{1}$ and $p = logistic(z)$. How do the odds of the outcome change if you increase $x_{1}$ by two? Demonstrate this.

Assume now that $\beta_1$ is negative. What value does $p$ approach as $x_{1}$ approaches $\infty$? What value does $p$ approach as $x_{1}$ approaches $-\infty$?

*If you increase $x_{1}$ by two, the odds of the outcome increase $e^{2\beta_{1}}$ times. If $\beta_{1}$ is negative, as $x_{1} \rightarrow \infty$, $\frac{p}{1-p}$ approaches $0$, and vice versa; as $x_{1} \rightarrow -\infty$, $\frac{p}{1-p}$ approaches $1$.*
