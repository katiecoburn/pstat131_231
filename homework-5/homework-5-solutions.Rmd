## Elastic Net Tuning

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.

### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(janitor)

pokemon <- read_csv("data/Pokemon.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()
```

*`clean_names()` transforms and saves all the variable or column names. By default, it saves them in snake case -- all lowercase, separated by underscores. It's often useful when there are a lot of columns with various naming styles, or when there are symbols that need to be dealt with.*

### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.

```{r}
pokemon %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = type_1)) +
  geom_bar()
```

How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?

*There are eighteen levels of the outcome, or primary classes of Pokemon, in the data. The classes with the smallest numbers of Pokemon are Flying and Fairy.*

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by simply filtering them out. Filter the entire data set to contain only Pokémon whose `type_1` is Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic.

```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>% 
  filter(type_1 %in% c('Bug', 'Fire', 'Grass', 'Normal', 'Water', 'Psychic'))
pokemon %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = type_1)) +
  geom_bar()
```

After filtering, convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.

```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>% 
  mutate(type_1 = factor(type_1), legendary = factor(legendary))
```

### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.

```{r}
set.seed(3435)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, prop = 0.7, strata = type_1)
pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)
dim(pokemon_train)
dim(pokemon_test)
```

*Any reasonable proportion is fine here, as long as there are more observations in the training set than in testing, and there are some observations in both.*

Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.* Why might stratifying the folds be useful?

```{r}
set.seed(3435)
pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(data = pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = type_1)
```

*Stratifying the folds can be useful for the same reason stratifying the initial split can be/is; because it makes sure the distribution of a specified variable (often the outcome) remains the same across resamples or, in cross-validation, across folds.*

### Exercise 4

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;

- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + 
                           sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + 
                           hp + sp_def, data = pokemon_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
```

### Exercise 5

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, we'll let `penalty` range from -5 to 5 (it's log-scaled).

```{r}
elastic_net_spec <- multinom_reg(penalty = tune(), 
                                 mixture = tune()) %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("glmnet")

en_workflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe) %>% 
  add_model(elastic_net_spec)

en_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(-5, 5)), 
                        mixture(range = c(0, 1)), levels = 10)
```

How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?

*We're fitting a grid of 100 combinations of values for the hyperparameters `penalty` and `mixture`, or 100 models, and we're fitting each of these once per fold, for a total of 500 models.*

### Exercise 6

Fit the models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tune_res <- tune_grid(
  en_workflow,
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = en_grid
)
write_rds(tune_res, "tuning-results.rds")
pokemon %>% select(hp)

%in%
```

Use `autoplot()` on the results. What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?

```{r}
read_rds()
autoplot(tune_res)
```

*Smaller values of penalty, or "amount of regularization," and smaller values of mixture, or "proportion of lasso penalty," tend to result in higher ROC-AUC and accuracy values. Answers here can vary, but aren't required to get more detailed/specific than this.*

### Exercise 7

Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`. Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

```{r}
best_model <- select_best(tune_res, metric = "roc_auc")

en_final <- finalize_workflow(en_workflow, best_model)

en_final_fit <- fit(en_final, data = pokemon_train)

predicted_data <- augment(en_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>% 
  select(type_1, starts_with(".pred"))
```

### Exercise 8

Calculate the overall ROC AUC on the testing set.

```{r}
predicted_data %>% roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
```


Then create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome. Also make a heat map of the confusion matrix.

```{r}
predicted_data %>% roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water) %>% 
  autoplot()
```

```{r}
predicted_data %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

What do you notice? How did your model do? Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? Do you have any ideas why this might be?

*Answers here may vary, depending on students' interpretation and also on variation in model results. In other words, because of random sampling in the initial split and in the cross-validation (unless the exact same seed was set), values will differ.*

*Students should note the classes that their model is worst at differentiating; here, the model is worst at identifying Grass- and Water-type, based on the ROC curves. They should also identify those it's best at; here that appears to be Psychic- and Normal-type.*

*In the heat map, notice that correct classifications are always on the diagonal and misclassifications on the off-diagonals. The model correctly identified 18/30 Normal-type, for example. From the heat map, we can see that the model doesn't seem to be able to distinguish Water-type well at all; it misclassifies other types as Water frequently, especially Grass.*

*Students aren't required to speculate as to why this might be, but if they do, any answers are fine. Personal theory is that the stats themselves may not differentiate type very well, but learned moves might work as better predictors.*

## For 231 Students

### Exercise 9

In the 2020-2021 season, Stephen Curry, an NBA basketball player, made 337 out of 801 three point shot attempts (42.1%). Use bootstrap resampling on a sequence of 337 1’s (makes) and 464 0’s (misses). For each bootstrap sample, compute and save the sample mean (e.g. bootstrap FG% for the player). Use 1000 bootstrap samples to plot a histogram of those values. Compute the 99% bootstrap confidence interval for Stephen Curry’s “true” end-of-season FG% using the quantile function in R. Print the endpoints of this interval.

```{r}
steve_curry <- c(rep(1, 337), rep(0, 464))
```

*There may be multiple ways to solve this problem. One is to use a loop to generate the bootstrap samples:*

```{r}
bootstrap_means <- NULL # Setting up an empty object to store samples
set.seed(3435)

for(i in 1:1000){ # Doing this for 1000 samples
  boot_sample <- sample(steve_curry, replace = T) # The sampling
  bootstrap_means[i] <- mean(boot_sample) # Storing the mean of each sample
}

data <- tibble(bootstrap_means)

ggplot(aes(x = bootstrap_means), 
       data = data) + geom_histogram()
```

*Here is a histogram of the values. It's centered approximately around 0.42, which is what would be expected. To get a $99\%$ confidence interval from this distribution, we can ask for the distribution's $0.005$ and $0.995$ quantiles:*

```{r}
quantile(bootstrap_means, c(0.005, 0.995))
```

*And the $99\%$ confidence interval for Curry's "true" end-of-season FG\% is from $0.37$ to $0.47$. Note that these numbers will differ unless students set the same seed; this is an artifact of random sampling and is fine.*
